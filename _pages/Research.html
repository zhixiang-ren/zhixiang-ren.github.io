          Mining the potential of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in treating modern diseases requires a profound understanding of its action mechanism and a comprehensive knowledge system that seamlessly bridges modern medical insights with traditional theories. 
          However, existing databases for modernizing TCM are plagued by varying degrees of information loss, which impede the multidimensional dissection of pharmacological effects. 
          To address this challenge, we introduce traditional Chinese medicine modernization (TCMM), the currently largest modernized TCM database that integrates pioneering intelligent pipelines. 
          By aligning high-quality TCM and modern medicine data, TCMM boasts the most extensive TCM modernization knowledge, including 20 types of modernized TCM concepts such as prescription, ingredient, target and 46 biological relations among them, totaling 3,447,023 records. 
          We demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of TCMM with two features, prescription generation and knowledge discovery, the outcomes show consistency with biological experimental results.

          Cytokines are small protein molecules that exhibit potent immunoregulatory properties, which are known as the essential components of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). 
          While some cytokines are known to be universally upregulated in TIME, the unique cytokine expression patterns have not been fully resolved in specific types of cancers. 
          To address this challenge, we develop a TIME single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, which is designed to study cytokine expression patterns for precise cancer classification. 
          The dataset, including 39 cancers, is constructed by integrating 684 tumor scRNA-seq samples from multiple public repositories. 
          After screening and processing, the dataset retains only the expression data of immune cells. 
          With a machine learning classification model, unique cytokine expression patterns are identified for various cancer categories and pioneering applied to cancer classification with an accuracy rate of 78.01%. 
          Our method will not only boost the understanding of cancer-type-specific immune modulations in TIME but also serve as a crucial reference for future diagnostic and therapeutic research in cancer immunity.
